# History #

While working in a Digital TV receptor project, I needed to capture a broadscast signal to analyse it. Lacking of messurment instruments, I found the NU HORIZON EVAL Spartan 3A dsp Kit was a good start for 200 dollars. The Kit has two 14-bits differential-input 500Mhz-bandwith-amplifier 120-MS/s analog to digital convertion, an 100M ethernet port, 32 Megabyte 16bits-word DDR 333MT/s, a VGA port and other components, all in one kit, for 200 U$S.
