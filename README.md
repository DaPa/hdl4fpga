# History #

While working in a Digital TV receptor project, I needed to capture a broadscast signal to analyse it. Lacking of messurent instruments, I found the NU HORIZON EVAL Spartan 3A dsp Kit was a good start for 200 dollars. The Kit has two 14-bits differential-input 500 Mhz-bandwith 120-MS/s ADC, an ethernet port, 32 Megabyte DDR 333MT/s, a VGA port and others all in one for 200 U$S.
